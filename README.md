# Game Library
This is a project I am making for coding experience as well as for the Summer of Making hackathon put on by Hack Club and GitHub

This project is a game library for "classic games" that I have coded myself (with a little help from ChatGPT lol). You will be able to play the games either from GitHub pages or just download the files and open the index.html

The games currently included are:
* Snake
* Flappy Bird (unfinished)

You can play the current games here:

## AI Usage
ChatGPT was used in this project to help me learn how do do stuff in javascript, html, and CSS, however it did not soley write the code to this project, it only guided me. A few sections were generated directly by it but I created most of the code myself. The windsurf AI autocomplete extention for VS code was also used to speed up the coding process. ChatGPT and windsurf did make most of the CSS, because who likes writing CSS.

More information about how AI was used in the creation of this project can be found in the comments of my code (currently not done commenting)
